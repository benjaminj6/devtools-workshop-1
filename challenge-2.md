# Challenge #2: Changing markup

2. Let's include links to social media at the bottom. 
  - Add a footer element at the bottom of the page
  - Include links to at least two social media accounts (twitter, github, linkedin, etc.). 
  - The links should open your account in a new tab.

3. **Bonus:** style the footer to look like [this mockup](./img/footer.png).
