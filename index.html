# Why Chrome DevTools?

## 1. Productivity
## 2. Professionalism
## 3. Deeper Insight

???

### Productivity
- Using Chrome DevTools will allow you to prototype/try things out in the browser without context switching back-and-forth between your editor and the browser.

### Professionalism
- Chances are the pros are using developer tools _every. single. day._ Knowing your way around the tooling makes you look like you've been developing a lot longer than 3-6 months.

### Deeper Insight
- There's a lot of things that you can inspect/debug using developer tools that you wouldn't be able to profile/inspect otherwise.
- You can inspect _any_ page...so if you see something you like on a website, you can actually inspect _exactly_ how it is done.

## Inspecting Your Site on Different Device Sizes
- Note: this mode does not account for _real_ browser support differences...in order to adequately know what your device looks like on actual devices you should test on an actual device.
- However, this mode is crucial if you are doing mobile-first design since you can view what the website looks like at different breakpoints.
