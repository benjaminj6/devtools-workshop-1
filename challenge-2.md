# Challenge #2: CSS & Responsive Design

## Inspect the [sample app](https://benjaminj6.github.io/devtools-workshop-1/example/) at a mobile viewport size.

You'll notice that this site is _not_ responsive in any way, shape, or form. What we are going to do in this exercise is add styles to make the site responsive.

## A couple things to note as you go
- **You shouldn't have to delete styles, although you can overwrite styles.** If this were an actual project, you wouldn't want to potentially mess up the desktop styles by removing CSS rules.
- Prototype your changes in Chrome, and then copy the changes into an external CSS file / gist. If we were working on an actual project all of these styles could be wrapped in a media query.
- Take a screenshot of the viewport when you are finished with your mobile styles makeover âœ¨.
