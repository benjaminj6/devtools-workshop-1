# Why Chrome DevTools?

## 1. Productivity
## 2. Professionalism
## 3. Deeper Insight

???

### Productivity
- Using Chrome DevTools will allow you to prototype/try things out in the browser without context switching back-and-forth between your editor and the browser.

### Professionalism
- Chances are the pros are using developer tools _every. single. day._ Knowing your way around the tooling makes you look like you've been developing a lot longer than 3-6 months.

### Deeper Insight
- There's a lot of things that you can inspect/debug using developer tools that you wouldn't be able to profile/inspect otherwise.
- You can inspect _any_ page...so if you see something you like on a website, you can actually inspect _exactly_ how it is done.

# Today's Scope: The Elements Tab

## Live-Editing & Inspecting the DOM
## Live-Editing & Inspecting CSS
## Inspecting Your Site on Different Device Sizes

## Live-Editing & Inspecting the DOM
## Live-Editing & Inspecting CSS
## Inspecting Your Site on Different Device Sizes
- Note: this mode does not account for _real_ browser support differences...in order to adequately know what your device looks like on actual devices you should test on an actual device.
- However, this mode is crucial if you are doing mobile-first design since you can view what the website looks like at different breakpoints.

# Inspecting/Live-Editing the DOM

???
## Things to demo
### selecting an element
### edit an element's attributes
- change item `href` to open one of the links to `www.thinkful.com`

### Adding an element to the DOM
- add an `a` tag to the top of the document to my website

## Shortcuts
- arrow keys to navigate faster

---
# Inspecting/Live-Editing Different Sizes

???
### View different breakpoints
### Device Emulator
### Changing the Percentage Size to view larger screens

---
# Inspecting/Live-Editing CSS

???
## Things to demo
### Adding a rule (`+` icon)
### `inspector-stylesheet` for more complex rules (media queries, states)
### Adding states to an element to lock it into a state
### Toggling classes/rules on an element with the CSS tab
### Viewing _all_ rules applied to a single element
---
# Challenge: Responsive Design

### 1. View the [example repo](<!-- TODO - add link -->)
### 2. Note how this design is _not_ mobile-first _or_ responsive.
### 3. Add styles / media queries to make the mobile design look like [this mockup](./img/challenge-responsive.png)
