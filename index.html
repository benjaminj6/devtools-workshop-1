# Why Chrome DevTools?

## 1. Productivity
## 2. Professionalism
## 3. Deeper Insight

???

### Productivity
- Using Chrome DevTools will allow you to prototype/try things out in the browser without context switching back-and-forth between your editor and the browser.

### Professionalism
- Chances are the pros are using developer tools _every. single. day._ Knowing your way around the tooling makes you look like you've been developing a lot longer than 3-6 months.

### Deeper Insight
- There's a lot of things that you can inspect/debug using developer tools that you wouldn't be able to profile/inspect otherwise.
- You can inspect _any_ page...so if you see something you like on a website, you can actually inspect _exactly_ how it is done.

# Today's Scope: The Elements Tab

## Live-Editing & Inspecting the DOM
## Live-Editing & Inspecting CSS
## Inspecting Your Site on Different Device Sizes

???
## Live-Editing & Inspecting the DOM
## Live-Editing & Inspecting CSS
## Inspecting Your Site on Different Device Sizes
- Note: this mode does not account for _real_ browser support differences...in order to adequately know what your device looks like on actual devices you should test on an actual device.
- However, this mode is crucial if you are doing mobile-first design since you can view what the website looks like at different breakpoints.

# Inspecting/Live-Editing the DOM

???
## Things to demo
### selecting an element
### edit an element's attributes
- change item `href` to open one of the links to `www.thinkful.com`

### Adding an element to the DOM
- add an `a` tag to the top of the document to my website

## Shortcuts
- arrow keys to navigate faster

---
# Inspecting/Live-Editing Different Sizes

???
### View different breakpoints
### Device Emulator
### Changing the Percentage Size to view larger screens

---
# Inspecting/Live-Editing CSS

???
## Things to demo
### Adding a rule (`+` icon)
### `inspector-stylesheet` for more complex rules (media queries, states)
### Adding states to an element to lock it into a state
### Toggling classes/rules on an element with the CSS tab
### Viewing _all_ rules applied to a single element
---
# Challenge #1: Responsive Design

### 1. View the [example repo](<!-- TODO - add link -->)
### 2. Note how this design is _not_ mobile-first _or_ responsive.
### 3. Add styles / media queries to make the mobile design look like [this mockup](./img/challenge-responsive.png)

---
# Challenge #2: Changing markup

### 1. You'll notice that although the search input has a label, but there is currently no placeholder text. Add some placeholder text to the input
### 2. Let's include links to social media at the bottom. 
- Add a footer element at the bottom of the page
- Include links to at least two social media accounts (twitter, github, linkedin, etc.). 
- The links should open your account in a new tab.

### 3. **Bonus:** style the footer to look like [this mockup](./img/footer.png).
---
# Challenge: Adding & Styling Icons

### 1. Inspect a card. You'll notice that within the `stats` list there are `<i>` tags in the markup.
### 2. Add [this font-awesome stylesheet](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css) to the document. You should be able to the see the icons now.
### 3. Style the icons so that they look like [this mockup](./img/icons.png)
### 4. **Bonus:** Add extra CSS rules/selectors to apply a hover effect (bold text) to each icon
