# Challenge #1: HTML

### 1. View the [example repo](./examples/github-test) (Congrats — you're here! 🎉🎉🎉)
### 2. Examine the `form` element

### 3. Challenges 💪🏻

1. Make the `input` a required input by adding HTML attributes
2. Add some placeholder text to the input (for example: `ex. React, Angular, Vue`)
3. Make the button a different color
  - Tip: this site uses [bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com) & you have access to all bootstrap classes
4. Bonus: Add a link to end of the form
  - The link should go to https://help.github.com/articles/about-topics/ to provide the user more about searching topics
  - If you wish to style the button, **do not use the CSS tab of Chrome DevTools!** We will get to that later in the workshop. For now, if you want to style the button, do so using [these bootstrap utility classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/utilities-for-layout/) or [bootstrap's responsive grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/)
